# Buildable hounds repulser

Hound waves is a fun and useful game mechanic in early game, as they deliver monster meat, teeth and gems right to you. However in the late game players with certain playstyles feel forced to wait for the waves near a safe place before doing many various activities, which is not very fun. Also teeth accumulate over time and reach ridiculous number.

This mod allows to disable hound waves in "late" game in a slightly challenging way.

# How to use

1. Hunt down a Warg to get a brand new guaranteed drop - its tail. It doesn't burn, doesn't sink and is not edible.  
2. Use the tail and 360 hounds teeth (9 stacks aka one chest) to modify any Hound Mound. Beware of hounds that spawn from that mound!  
3. From that point, as long as the mound is not destroyed, hound waves are disabled. Hounds outside the waves are not affected anyhow.  

# Mod configuration

You can choose:  
* Amount of hounds teeth required
* Whether the Warg's tail is required
* The drop rate for the Warg's tail (or disable it completely)
* To make modification to Houndius Shootius instead of a Hound Mound. Please note that changing the target structure will remove effect from already modified ones (even if modification is not complete)  

Also please note that once you add resources to the construction, there is no way to get them back, even if you change any mod settings.  

# Known issues

* Crafting recipe does not render the tail ingredient
* Teeth can only be added at most 40 at once
* The construction widget does not correctly show values over 255 and starts showing 256 as 0 again, 257 as 1 etc, and 360 will be displayed as 104. This is purely visual issue
* Once construction is complete, the hound mound does not look any different
