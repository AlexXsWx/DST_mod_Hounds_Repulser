# Buildable hounds repulser

Hunt down a Warg to get its tail.  
Use the tail and chest worth of hounds teeth (360) to modify a Hound Mound.  
From that point, as long as the mound is not destroyed, hound waves are disabled.  

# Known issues

* Crafting recipe does not render the tail ingredient
* Teeth can only be added at most 40 at once
* Crafting recipe does not always correctly the number of show how many teeth already added (purely visual issue)
* Once construction is complete, the hound mound does not look any different
